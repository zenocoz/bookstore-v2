    <h2>Pair Programming - State // Props</h2>

    <h4>
      PAIR PROGRAMMING EXERCISE. 1 DRIVER, 1 NAVIGATOR. <br />

      1 Exercise each. Use GitHub to share the code. <br />
      Starting by creating a new React app by using the command
      create-react-app. <br />
      Include into your project Bootstrap / react-bootstrap
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a component called WarningSign which receives a text as a prop.
        This text should be presented inside an Alert of type danger
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a component called MyBadge which receives a text and a color as
        props. This component should render a Badge react-bootstrap component
        with those properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a SingleBook component as a function. The component receives a
        book object as a prop, and displays the cover and the title of the book.
        Use react-bootstrap Cards to display a book (The book object can be read
        from the one of the .json book files we gave you yesterday)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a BookList component. This component receives by props a list of
        books and displays them using the SingleBook component
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a FilterBookList feature. By writing into an input field a search
        query, the BookList should show only the books with the specified string
        into the title (save the query into the BookList component state and
        filter the books accordingly).
      </li>
      <li>
        Convert your SingleBook component to a class, and create its state
        containing a 'selected' boolean property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on a SingleBook should toggle its 'selected' state property. If
        the 'selected' property is true, the SingleBook should have some styling
        resembling it.
      </li>
      <li>Publish everything on GitHub (for both)</li>
    </ol>
